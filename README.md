# Lost in Space - So Let's Panic
Anagram solver in C++.


# FIXME list

* Use `const` more wherever appropriate.
* Make it not leak memory.
* Add tests to uncover more bugs.
* Make interactive UI work (currently it's only possible to pass in parameters on the command line).


# New feature ideas

* Support for multi-word anagrams.
* Allow user to choose how many words the anagram should contain or how long the words should be (at most, at least).
